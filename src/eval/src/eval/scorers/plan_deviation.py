    Measures the consistency of ego's plans by computing the L2 distance between
    planned points for two consecutive timestamps (only on points for which we
    have a prediction at both timestamps).

    For aggregation of the L2 distances of each planned waypoint, we use an
    exponentially decaying average, i.e. weighing planned waypoints closer in
    time higher.

    Configuration:
    * incl_z: Whether to include the z-axis in the plan consistency computation.
    * avg_decay_rate: The decay rate for the plan consistency metric.
